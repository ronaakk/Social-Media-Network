## Specifications

- New Post: Users who are signed in can create new posts by filling in text into a text area and attach an image by filling in the post content and uploading an image file. Each post displays the username of the poster, the post content, date and time of posting, and the number of likes and comments.

- All Posts: The "All Posts" page allows users to view all posts from all users, sorted by most recent. Each post includes essential details, such as the poster's username, content, posting date, and the number of likes and comments.

- Profile Page: Clicking on a username displays that user's profile page. The profile page shows the number of followers and followed users, along with the user's posts in reverse chronological order.

- Following: The "Following" page displays all posts made by users that the current user follows.

- Edit Post: Users can edit their own posts by clicking an "Edit" button, which opens a textarea to edit the post content. The edited content can be saved using JavaScript, avoiding a full page reload.

- "Like" and "Unlike": Users can toggle the "like" status of posts using JavaScript, updating the like count without a page reload.

- Image Upload: Users can associate images with each post by uploading pictures.

- Comments: Users can comment on posts, engaging in conversations and discussions.

- Delete Posts and Comments: Users can delete their own posts and comments.

## Technology Used

Tweetify is built using the following technologies:

## What I Learned

During the development of Tweetify, I gained valuable insights and skills in various areas:

- Implementing APIs: I learned how to use fetch calls and asynchronous requests to retrieve and update data dynamically, improving user experience.
- Frontend Interactivity: I enhanced my proficiency in JavaScript to create interactive elements, such as dynamic content loading, toggling likes, and editing posts without page reloads.
- Backend Development: I expanded my knowledge of Django to build robust backend functionality, handle user authentication, manage data models, and ensure secure interactions.
- Efficient Code Design: I focused on optimizing code structure and design to create a smooth and responsive user interface.
